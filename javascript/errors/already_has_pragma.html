<h2 id="what_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>
<p>A source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.</p> <p>JavaScript sources are often combined and minified to make delivering them from the server more efficient. With source maps, the debugger can map the code being executed to the original source files. There are two ways to assign a source map, either by using a comment or by setting a header to the JavaScript file.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="setting_source_maps">Setting source maps</h3>
<p>Setting a source map by using a comment in the file:</p> <pre data-language="js"><span class="token comment">//# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map</span></pre> <p>Or, alternatively, you can set a header to your JavaScript file:</p> <pre data-language="js"><span class="token constant">X</span><span class="token operator">-</span>SourceMap<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token operator">/</span>path<span class="token operator">/</span>to<span class="token operator">/</span>file<span class="token punctuation">.</span>js<span class="token punctuation">.</span>map</pre>
